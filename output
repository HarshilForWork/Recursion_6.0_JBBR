[00:38] attitude you can't do that not only is
[00:40] it a violation of California state law
[00:42] it flies directly in the face of
[00:43] Cheesecake Factory policy yeah know
[00:45] there's a new policy no shoes no shirt
[00:47] no
[00:49] Sheldon I bet we could sell that sign

[00:57] Pasadena oh
[01:03] hello time to do your laundry huh
[01:06] Saturday night Saturday is laundry night
[01:10] I know every Saturday at
[01:13] 8:15 easy to
[01:18] anticipate what are you implying I'm
[01:21] implying that you're a creature of habit
[01:24] and if something were to prevent you
[01:25] from doing your laundry on Saturday at
[01:27] 8:15 you might find it
[01:37] unpleasant knuckle under my
[01:47] ass oh no are all the machines
[01:53] taken what are you going to
[01:56] do no problem I'll just do my laundry
[02:01] another
[02:02] night another night well I guess you can
[02:05] try but deep inside your heart you'll
[02:08] know that laundry night is always
[02:10] Saturday
[02:15] night woman you are playing with forces
[02:18] beyond your
[02:19] Ken yeah well your Ken can kiss my
[02:22] Barbie how come you didn't go to work
[02:25] today I'm taking a sabatical because I
[02:27] won't cow toow To Mediocre Minds
[02:30] so you got canned huh theoretical
[02:33] physicists do not get
[02:35] canned but
[02:38] yeah maybe it's all for the best you
[02:40] know I always say when one door closes
[02:42] another one opens no it
[02:45] doesn't not unless the two doors are
[02:47] connected by relays or there are motion
[02:49] sensors involved no no I me the first
[02:51] door closing creates a change of air
[02:52] pressure that acts upon the second
[02:55] door never
[02:57] mind slow down slow down please slow
[03:01] down we're fine you're not leaving
[03:03] yourself enough space between cars oh
[03:05] sure I am no no let me do the math for
[03:08] you this car weighs let's say Â£4,000 now
[03:11] add 140 for me 120 for you 120 oh I'm
[03:14] sorry did I insult you is your body mass
[03:17] somehow tied into yourself
[03:18] worth well yeah interesting anyway that
[03:23] gives us a total weight of let's say
[03:25] 4,400 lb let's say
[03:27] 4390 fine
[03:30] we're traveling forward at good Lord 51
[03:33] mph now let's assume that your brakes
[03:35] are new and the calipers are aligned
[03:37] still by the time we come to a stop
[03:39] we'll be occupying the same space as
[03:40] that Buick in front of us an
[03:42] impossibility that nature will quickly
[03:44] resolve into death mutilation and oh
[03:46] look they built a new putt putt
[03:51] course this is great look at me I'm in
[03:54] the real world of ordinary people just
[03:57] living their ordinary colorless work a
[03:59] day lives
[04:01] thank you no thank you thank you
[04:04] ordinary
[04:07] person hey you want to hear an
[04:09] interesting thing about tomatoes uh no
[04:11] no not really listen didn't you say you
[04:14] needed some eggs yes but anyone who
[04:16] knows anything about the Dynamics of
[04:18] bacterial growth knows to pick up their
[04:19] refrigerated Foods on the way out of the
[04:21] supermarket oh okay well maybe you
[04:23] should start heading on out
[04:25] then no this is fun oh the thing about
[04:28] tomatoes and I think think you'll really
[04:30] enjoy this is they're shelved with the
[04:32] vegetables but they're technically a
[04:34] fruit oh interesting isn't it no I mean
[04:37] what you find
[04:42] enjoyable oh
[04:45] boy what
[04:47] now well there's some value to taking a
[04:49] multivitamin but the human body can only
[04:51] absorb so much but you're buying here
[04:54] are the ingredients for very expensive
[04:57] urine well maybe that's what I was going
[05:00] for well then you'll want some
[05:09] manganese well that was fun maybe
[05:12] tomorrow we can go to one of those big
[05:13] warehouse stores oh I don't know Sheldon
[05:15] it's going to take me a while to recover
[05:17] from all the fun I had
[05:19] today are you sure there are a lot of
[05:22] advantages to buying in bulk I for
[05:24] example I noticed that you purchase your
[05:26] tampons one month supply at a time
[05:30] what what think about it it's a product
[05:33] that doesn't spoil and you're going to
[05:35] be needing them for at least the next 30
[05:37] Years you want me to buy 30 years worth
[05:40] of
[05:41] tampons well 30 35 when did your mother
[05:43] go into menopause okay mine if I start
[05:47] um
[05:48] Penny that's where I
[05:52] sit the next to
[05:55] me no I said
[05:58] there what's the difference
[06:00] what's the difference here we
[06:02] go in the winter that seat is close
[06:04] enough to the radiator to remain warm
[06:06] and yet not so close as to cause
[06:07] perspiration in the summer it's directly
[06:09] in the path of a cross Breeze created by
[06:11] opening Windows there and there it faces
[06:13] the television at an angle that is
[06:15] neither direct thus discouraging
[06:16] conversation nor so far wide as to
[06:18] create a parallax Distortion I could go
[06:20] on but I think I've made my
[06:25] point do you want me to move well just
[06:28] sit somewhere else
[06:50] fine Sheldon
[06:53] sit ah in 1935 Irwin schinger in an
[06:58] attempt to explain the cop haen
[06:59] interpretation of quantum physics he
[07:01] proposed an experiment where a cat is
[07:04] placed in a box with a sealed vial of
[07:06] poison that will break open at a random
[07:08] time now since no one knows when or if
[07:11] the poison has been released until the
[07:13] box is opened the cat can be thought of
[07:15] is both alive and
[07:22] dead I'm sorry I don't get the point of
[07:25] course you don't get it I haven't made
[07:26] it
[07:28] yet you have to be psychic to get it and
[07:30] there's no such thing as psychic show
[07:31] them what's the point just like
[07:34] Schrodinger's cat your potential
[07:36] relationship with Leonard right now can
[07:38] be thought of as both good and bad it is
[07:40] only by opening the box that you'll find
[07:42] out which it
[07:44] is okay so you're saying I should go out
[07:47] with Leonard no no no no no
[07:50] no let me start again in
[07:57] 193 tonight
[08:02] I have to
[08:05] go
[08:07] tonight what the hell is
[08:10] that I don't know but if cats could
[08:13] sing they'd hate it
[08:20] too you proud be my night I will take my
[08:26] hey guys hi where are you going what we
[08:30] just had to mail some
[08:32] letters and throw away some
[08:38] [Laughter]
[08:52] chicken you'll never guess what just
[08:54] happened oh I I give up I don't guess as
[08:57] a scientist I reach conclusions based on
[08:59] observation and
[09:01] experimentation although as I'm saying
[09:02] this it occurs to me you may have been
[09:04] employing a rhetorical device rendering
[09:06] my response
[09:07] moot what was that believe it or not
[09:10] personal growth what happened all right
[09:13] remember when I auditioned for that
[09:14] Workshop production of rent but I didn't
[09:16] get it and I couldn't figure out why I
[09:17] have a conclusion based on an
[09:19] observation no you don't no he
[09:21] doesn't well the girl they picked to
[09:23] play Mimi she dropped out and they asked
[09:25] me to replace her oh congratulations
[09:27] what a lucky break it's not a big deal
[09:29] just a one night showcase but they
[09:30] invite a lot of casting people and
[09:32] agents so you never know I think I know
[09:34] no you
[09:35] don't he doesn't it's this Friday at 8
[09:38] you guys want to come
[09:41] no
[09:43] because uh Friday we are attending a
[09:47] symposium on molecular patronum I think
[09:49] that's a week from Tuesday at 6 no it's
[09:51] this Friday at
[09:54] 8 oh too bad well I got to get to
[09:56] rehearsal see you guys see you let's go

[10:13] computer in the front entrance with the
[10:14] one in my refrigerated Warehouse here
[10:16] buy this one look it's the one we're
[10:17] getting see happy guy no no no no no she
[10:19] doesn't want that she needs a point
[10:21] to-point peer network with a range
[10:24] extender thank you which hard drive do I
[10:26] want fire wire or USB it depends on what
[10:30] bus you have
[10:34] available I drive a Chevy
[10:38] Cavalier oh dear lord Sheldon we have to
[10:41] go not now Penny this poor man needs me
[10:43] you hold on I'll be right with
[10:45] you what computer do you have and please
[10:48] don't say a white
[10:51] one okay we don't have that in
[10:55] stock but I can special order it for you
[11:00] him excuse me sir you don't work here
[11:04] yes well apparently neither does anyone
[11:07] else Sheldon we have to go why well for
[11:10] one thing we're late for Leonard's
[11:12] birthday party and for another I told
[11:13] him to call
[11:15] security good
[11:19] luck by the way a six-year-old could
[11:21] hack your computer system keep walking
[11:23] yeah 1 2 3 4 is not a secure
[11:25] password
[11:27] uhoh what I was going to get my mail
[11:34] okay are are you hoping to get it
[11:37] telepathically I think you mean
[11:40] telekinetically and no I just wasn't
[11:43] sure of the proper protocol now that you
[11:45] and Leonard are no longer having Kus oh
[11:48] God can we please just say no longer
[11:50] seeing each other well we could if it
[11:52] were true but as you live in the same
[11:54] building you see each other all the time
[11:56] the variable which has changed is the
[11:58] kius
[12:00] okay here's the protocol you and I are
[12:02] still friends and you stop saying
[12:05] Kus good good I'm glad we're still
[12:08] friends really oh yes it was a lot of
[12:11] work to accommodate you in my life I'd
[12:13] hate for that effort to have been in
[12:16] vain right just to be clear do I have to
[12:20] stop saying coidus with everyone or just
[12:22] you everyone do you go on many dates uh
[12:27] I wouldn't say many a few
[12:35] what's your characterization of
[12:37] approximately 171 different men is a few
[12:41] what where did you get 171 men simple
[12:45] extrapolation in the three years that
[12:47] I've known you you were single for two
[12:50] during that time I saw 17 different
[12:52] suitors if we work backwards correcting
[12:54] for observation bias and postula an
[12:57] initial dating age of 15 wait wait wait
[12:59] I did not start dating at 15 I'm sorry
[13:02] 16
[13:05] 14 my mistake now assuming the left side
[13:08] of a bell curve peing around the present
[13:11] that would bring the total up to 193 men
[13:15] plus or minus eight
[13:18] men remarkable did you have sexual
[13:21] intercourse with all of these men no
[13:23] although that number would be fairly
[13:25] easy to calculate based on the number of
[13:27] awkward encounters I've had with strange
[13:29] men leaving her apartment in the morning
[13:31] plus the number of times she's returned
[13:33] home wearing the same clothes she wore
[13:35] the night before okay Shon I think
[13:36] you've made your point so we multiply
[13:39] 193 minus 21 Men before the loss of
[13:42] virginity so 172 * .18 gives us 3.96
[13:48] sexual
[13:50] partners let's round that up to
[13:52] 31 okay Sheldon you are so wrong that is
[13:56] not even close to the real number I'm
[13:58] going need to drink over here we're
[14:02] home it's 10:00 Where Have You Been we
[14:05] stayed for the California Venture water
[14:07] show it was pure Disney
[14:10] Magic I was going to see that with him

[14:15] right I I'll see it again with you and I
[14:17] have food here you said you were going
[14:18] to call I know I know I can still eat no

[14:35] taking you to Disneyland thank you
[14:38] Penny consider this unlikely but very
[14:41] plausible scenario a young woman alone

[15:03] geniuses and their friend
[15:08] Howard hey hang on let's see where he's
[15:12] going she befriends them and then lies
[15:15] in wait until they reveal a marketable
[15:17] idea which she steals and sells to the
[15:20] highest bidder that is ridiculous oh is
[15:23] it let's see you come up with an
[15:24] explanation as to why this woman hangs
[15:26] out with us all the time
[15:32] okay you know what I've already mooched

[17:25] once was it better than your idea to
[17:27] move to Los Angeles and become a famous
[17:31] actress okay look when you see someone
[17:33] wearing shoes you like you just snap a
[17:35] picture of them and the app goes on the
[17:37] internet to find out where you can buy
[17:39] them that's your app idea you don't like
[17:42] it I didn't say that but no I
[17:46] [Music]

[17:54] Crocs these are knockoff Manolo blonic
[17:57] bored
[18:00] look you said it yourself we have to

[18:51] bodies they can draw water in through
[18:53] their genitals
[18:55] [Laughter]
[19:03] yeah well I don't think we're going to
[19:04] get to do that

[19:10] drink a milkshake without getting brain
[19:15] freeze oh hey now we go to reverse
[19:24] Warrior how did she get you to do yoga
[19:27] well to be honest I thought she said
[19:31] Yoda die this evening with no
[19:33] opportunity to communicate with anyone
[19:35] what would you most regret not having
[19:37] told
[19:38] someone so it would be
[19:41] today
[19:43] huh I suppose there's something
[19:45] satisfying about dying on my
[19:47] birthday today's your birthday yes what
[19:52] that's always been a secret not even Amy
[19:55] knows well I don't enjoy presents
[19:59] and the thought of people jumping out
[20:01] and yelling surprise fills me with more
[20:04] dread than the words George Lucas
[20:06] director's
[20:08] cut so why did you finally tell
[20:11] me the point of the experiment is to be
[20:13] completely honest with each
[20:16] other thank you for sharing it with me I
[20:19] won't tell anyone thank
[20:23] you thank you for walking me home just
[20:27] want to make sure you get there safe

[20:46] has and after I let you be
[20:49] Gary Penny
[20:54] Penny what's the
[20:56] matter um
[20:59] well I was worried that you might be
[21:00] missing
[21:02] Leonard and that might be causing you to
[21:05] have bad dreams like the kind you'd get
[21:08] if you watched Clash of the Titans right
[21:09] before you went to
[21:11] bed sweetie did you have a bad
[21:15] dream to be honest I
[21:17] did Back to the Future 2 was in the Back
[21:20] to the Future 3
[21:22] case Leonard did
[21:24] it good night you no
[21:27] wait perhaps I should sleep here so you
[21:31] don't miss Leonard as much because
[21:33] you're being kind of a baby about
[21:39] it you know what that would make me feel
[21:43] better thank you you're
[21:48] welcome good
[21:52] night I don't think there's anything in
[21:54] this jewelry store that Amy would
[21:56] appreciate more than the humidifier we
[21:58] were just looking at it
[22:00] Sears oh my God now I know what I sound
[22:03] like to you when I say stupid
[22:08] stuff oh a pocket watch okay I don't

[22:13] maybe she wants a man with a pocket
[22:16] watch still saying stupid
[22:20] stuff o she like bracelets well she's
[22:24] very fond of her silver one that says
[22:26] allergic to penicillin

[22:30] that well how are we doing this
[22:32] afternoon are we looking for anything
[22:33] special perhaps a ring for the lady
[22:36] trust me we are not a

[26:55] I'm down to seven friends
[26:59] he counting Hobbits and superheroes

[27:05] Leonard made it not exist I want it more
[27:07] than anything in the world the element
[27:09] never existed I didn't take it away
[27:12] science took it away be mad at science
[27:13] don't you dare use science against
[27:16] me science is my best friend oh good I'm
[27:19] back up to

[27:38] you so I
[27:39] agree okay Sheldon what do you want me
[27:42] to do uh hide the information if I don't
[27:44] publish it it's just a matter of time
[27:46] before someone else does but no no of
[27:48] course you have to publish that's your
[27:49] responsibility as a scientist doing
[27:51] otherwise would be unethical you have no
[27:54] choice fine I'll publish can you believe
[27:56] this guy here are some topics that
[27:58] interest me quantum mechanics trains
[28:01] Flags no no it's about my acting career
[28:04] oh I'm sorry that's not on the list well
[28:06] oh wait no how about we split the
[28:09] difference and discuss why Austria was
[28:12] an arch duche and not just a regular
[28:15] duy okay look here's the thing I like
[28:17] pharmaceutical sales it's going great
[28:19] but I have an audition for a movie and
[28:21] if I get it it could screw everything up
[28:23] H I know exactly what you should do
[28:26] unfortunately I cannot tell you
[28:30] well why I'm attempting to turn over a
[28:33] new Leaf earlier today it was pointed
[28:35] out to me that I tend to force my ideas
[28:37] on
[28:38] people you're really not going to tell
[28:41] me no that train has left the
[28:44] station now we can play this one of two
[28:47] ways you can say trains tell me more or
[28:51] you can just look at me like that and
[28:53] I'll start who do we love Benny who do
[28:56] we love Benny who do we love
[29:00] Kenny hello Sheldon come on in thank you

[29:18] perhaps you'd like to take in a prize
[29:21] fight God are you trying to make Amy
[29:24] jealous no why is everyone so obsessed
[29:27] with and Stewart and whether or not they
[29:29] may be having more pumpkin Lattes or
[29:31] intercourse
[29:34] tonight okay listen to me that playing
[29:36] games is not going to help get Amy back
[29:39] I am not trying to get her back but out
[29:42] of curiosity what is a
[29:44] way all right honey let me tell you a
[29:46] story there's a guy I liked and I never
[29:49] told him how I felt eventually he
[29:50] started going out with someone else and
[29:52] I always regretted it do you see where
[29:55] I'm going with this I believe I do H I'm
[29:59] the
[30:04] guy you're not the guy are you sure that
[30:08] would explain so much your constant
[30:10] presence in my apartment at baffling
[30:13] diance with Leonard just to be near me
[30:15] why you call me sweetie all the time I
[30:18] call everyone sweetie you
[30:23]  look Sheldon all I'm saying is
[30:25] strap on a pair and go talk to Amy strap
[30:28] on a pair what
[30:33] skates oh sweetie you are so not the guy
[30:37] it seems only logical that to restore
[30:39] balance to the relationship you should
[30:41] find another man and Dally with him and
[30:44] by dally I mean some hardcore
[30:45] mouth-on-mouth
[30:47] action okay that is the stupidest thing
[30:49] I've ever heard you actually think he's
[30:51] on to
[30:52] something well you can't be serious cuz
[30:55] I messed up and made out with a girl
[30:57] you're going to do the same with a
[30:58] random guy I'm currently
[31:03] single that's true you
[31:07] are what is
[31:10] happening I will tell you what is
[31:12] happening I am saving my best friend's
[31:23] marriage since Amy and I have been
[31:25] living together we've been bickering

[31:29] you're afraid you're going to do
[31:30] something like your dad did yes I need
[31:33] to prepare her now to save her from pain
[31:36] down the road down the road Sheldon she
[31:39] wanted to share a toothbrush holder with
[31:40] you and now you're at an ice cream
[31:41] parlor trying to pick up
[31:45] women well anything could sound silly
[31:47] when you put it in that
[31:48] tone honey instead of worrying about
[31:51] pain you may cause in the future how
[31:52] about trying to fix the pain you're
[31:54] causing her right
[31:56] now I'm sure you're
[31:59] right and I suppose I should apologize
[32:01] to you as well okay that must have hurt
[32:06] watching me look for other women without

[35:07] honeymoon she has so little time well
[35:09] she does have her own job yeah but it's
[35:11] so
[35:12] dull trying to understand how the brain
[35:15] translates the Five Senses Into
[35:17] biochemical information I'd rather wait
[35:19] in line without my
[35:21] phone okay well Leonard's here now you
[35:24] can talk science with him where you
[35:26] going that thing you were late for one

[35:44] some virtual reality until you ruined it
[35:46] with your actual
[35:48] face what am I smelling oh it's car air
[35:52] freshener I was simulating the smell of
[35:54] the
[35:55] forest it's not what the forest smells
[35:57] like well how would I
[35:59] know Amy is the one constant I can count
[36:02] on and now she's changing it's just a
[36:04] haircut and some clothes no it's the
[36:06] last straw I can't take
[36:09] [Music]

[36:57] don't try to follow me all right you
[36:59] need a ride that'd be great thank you
[37:00] the entire point of emulating Spock was
[37:02] to rise above human emotion which I've
[37:05] spent a lifetime mastering
[37:09] oh excuse me I'm sorry I'm not here no
[37:13] you went what does
[37:15] mean um you did
[37:18] go okay fine well Sheldon I'm no expert
[37:22] aren't you completely missing the point
[37:23] of Spock he liked to act like you had no
[37:25] emotions but he was still half human
[37:27] just like
[37:29] you I'm just saying you pretend you
[37:31] don't but you have feelings just like
[37:32] everybody else not true no look at me
[37:36] you know I had an engagement ring to
[37:37] give a girl and instead she rejected me
[37:40] and am I emotional about that no no I am
[37:42] sitting here on a couch talking about my
[37:44] favorite TV character like nothing
[37:46] happened CU I am just like him all
[37:48] logical all the time sweetie you're
[37:50] yelling because when I speak at a
[37:51] regular volume no one seems to believe
[37:53] me that I put this Amy nonsense behind
[37:55] me

[38:08] awesome that's the fourth time she's
[38:10] been to the bathroom in the last 2

[38:51] clearly sick and she's going to take us
[38:53] all down with her she's not sick Sheldon
[38:56] she is and I'm going to catch it and
[38:57] it's going to ruin the greatest day of
[38:59] my life I promise you're not going to

[39:44] maturity you actually think it's 2003 no
[39:48] just because I'm living my life like it

[39:51] delusional and since it is 2003 I don't
[39:54] know who you are so please exit the
[39:57] premises before I called the police on
